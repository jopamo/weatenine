# üé® Random Paint ‚Äî Generative Grid Painter  
**Live demo:** <https://1g4.org/wa9/>

An interactive playground where multi-colour paint drops evolve into abstract art. Tweak the grid, set your rules, run experiments, and watch colours blend in real time.

## Introduction
Random Paint lets you create unique, algorithm-driven artwork with just a few clicks. Choose up to three base colours, decide when the run should stop, and enjoy the emergent patterns.

---

## Quick Start
1. Open the [demo](https://1g4.org/wa9/).  
2. Click anywhere to skip the intro animation.  
3. Choose **Simulation** or **Experiments** from the navbar.

---

## Canvas Controls
| Setting | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| **X / Y Dimension** | Set the grid width and height. |
| **Colour 1-3** | Pick up to three base colours (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, Maroon, Teal). |
| **Stopping Criterion** | ‚Ä¢ _Fill Grid_ ‚Äì stop when every square has paint.<br>‚Ä¢ _First Collision_ ‚Äì stop when any square receives its second drop.<br>‚Ä¢ Additional criteria may appear in future updates. |

---

## Run the Simulation
1. Click **Start Painting**.  
2. Every tick, one colour is chosen at random and dropped on a random cell.<br>
   ‚Ä¢ New paint blends with existing colour.  
   ‚Ä¢ The colour tracker (left sidebar) shows usage stats.  
3. Adjust tick speed with the slider.  
4. Click **Continue** to finish and view stats.

---

## Experiment Mode
1. Open **Experiments**.  
2. Select an **independent variable** (`D`, `X`, or `R`).  
3. Enter the value range.  
4. Click **Run Experiment** to collect data.

---

## Visualise Results
1. Choose the variables to plot.  
2. Press **Continue** ‚Üí a graph appears.  
3. Afterwards you can:  
   1. Generate another graph.  
   2. Run a new experiment.  
   3. Return to the simulation.
