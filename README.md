### ðŸŽ‰ Introduction

Hello, and thank you for utilizing our software!

This application will allow you to create the picture of your dreams in only a few inputs from the user.

---

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

When you open the website, there's an animation that shows what you can do.

---

### ðŸ–¼ Setting Up the Canvas

- Go to 'Simulation'.
- You can utilize the X-Dimension textbox in order to adjust the horizontal size of the graph and you can use the Y-Dimension to adjust the vertical size of the grid.
- Color 1, Color 2, and Color 3 can all be adjusted to an color available in the following boxes:
Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, Maroon, and Teal.
- Set the **stopping criterion**:
    1. Stop when all squares are painted.
    2. Stop when any square gets a second paint drop.
    3. Choose other options if available.

---

### ðŸ”„ Starting the Simulation

- Click 'Start Painting'.
- Every second, one of your colors will be chosen and will replace a random element on your grid. If a color is chosen that already has a color present, then the previous color will be blended with the new color. The 'color tracker' on the left will keep track of all the colors used.
- Use controls to change speed.
- Click **CONTINUE** when finished.

---

### ðŸ”¬ Running Experiments

- Go to 'Experiments'.
- Choose an **independent variable** (D, X, or R).
- Enter the needed values.
- Click 'Run Experiment' and see the results.

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Visualizing Results

- Select variables to visualize.
- Click **CONTINUE** for a graph.
- After viewing, you can:
    1. Make another graph.
    2. Do a new experiment.
    3. Exit.
